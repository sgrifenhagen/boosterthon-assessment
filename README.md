I've chosen to use CodeIgniter  CI3.1.8 as the framework with PHP 5.6.35, MySql v5.5.59, Bootstrap 4.1.0, and jQuery 3.2.1, along with a couple of open-source jQuery plugins.

I have 2 controllers (Home.php, and Review.PHP), a single model (Booster.php), and 3 views (view_home, view_process, and view_review). 

There are two tables used (Fundraiser and Reviews). The ddl to create the tables is in the repository, as well as the code.
